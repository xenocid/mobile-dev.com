* __[Jeff Atwood's Blog to Book](https://www.hyperink.com/Blog-To-Book-Effective-Programming-More-Than-Writing-Code-b1559)__:
  I read Jeff Atwood's blog for years and while he was quite often in the shadow of [his more famous partner](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/),
  he still was one of the most interesting engineering bloggers. He just released 
  his best blog posts as an [ebook](https://www.hyperink.com/Blog-To-Book-Effective-Programming-More-Than-Writing-Code-b1559) and while
  technically you can still read all those texts for free on his site, I think
  paying $2.99 for the privilege is the right thing. Plus it's easier to read using
  eBook reader apps, rather than through the browser, so I just paid happily.  
* __[Brain](https://github.com/harthur/brain)__:  
  Javascript library implementing neural network. Javascript is not my top choice for machine learning and AI experiments
  to be honest (I prefer Python and Ruby), but it's nevertheless interesting and useful library.
* __[CodeRunner](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Vg6WGCcESLE&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fcoderunner%252Fid433335799%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)__: 
  This is a really neat app that allows you quickly run short programs in half a dozen of the most 
  popular programming languages (C/C++, Lua, Ruby, Python, JavaScript etc). While I can definitely use Vim and command-line tools for all these
  programming languages, CodeRunner has been indispensable in two situations - while interviewing candidates and while studying programming and
  math classes at [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) and [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com). It's like having [jsFiddle](jsfiddle.net), but on your own machine
  and not just for Javascript.
