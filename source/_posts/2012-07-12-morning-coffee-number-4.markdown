* __[Pythonista](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Vg6WGCcESLE&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpythonista%252Fid528579881%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30")__: Right now iPad is not a proper development platform for numerous reasons, 
  including the awkwardness of typing code using the on-screen keyboard and Apple's
  restrictive rules, but I definitely see the signs of improvement lately and over time I think
  we will see iPad as a viable tool for the 'light-hearted' coding, i.e. experimentation,
  REPL-style code exploration and small-scale bug fixing/correction. Today I'd like to present you
  with another brick in the wall - [Pythonista](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Vg6WGCcESLE&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpythonista%252Fid528579881%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30")
  is a wonderful and very powerful tool for writing Python code right on your iPad.

* __[Making Train Games](http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/2012/07/starting-point-train-game-freeform-tracks/):__
  [Steffen Itterheim](http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/) of [Learn Cocos2D](http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/) and
  [Kobold2D](http://www.kobold2d.com/) fame published a quite thought-provoking [article](http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/2012/07/starting-point-train-game-freeform-tracks/)
  exploring different aspects of properly simulating train motion over curved railtracks. The article seems to be
  quite open-ended with a lot of work in progress and tons of links to other resources talking about train simulation,
  but if you're interested in doing train-based game that's a great starting point.
