<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/mattt/cupertino">Cupertino:</a></strong> I&#8217;m a big fan of the command line (at least when we are talking about development), so when I see a new tool, that eliminates yet another necessity to tolerate some web-based UI, it makes my heart sing. <a href="http://mattt.me/"> Matt Thompson </a> (of <a href="http://inductionapp.com/">Induction</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/"> AFNetworking </a> fame among other things) came up with <a href="https://github.com/mattt/cupertino">Cupertino</a> - command line tool/gem to automate things we normally do through the Apple&#8217;s Developer Portal, like managing devices, certificates etc. This is a perfection:

<ul>
<li><code>$ ios devices:list</code></li>
<li><code>$ ios devices:add "iPad 1"=abc123</code></li>
<li><code>$ ios devices:add "iPad 2"=def456 "iPad 3"=ghi789 …</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline">vim-powerline</a></strong>: I&#8217;m a big fan of Vim and I&#8217;m definitely going to post some Vim goodies in this blog almost daily, but I&#8217;d like to start with my recent discovery - <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline"> vim-powerline </a>.
<img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/3ea0c5e8e1da9827156bdd3d4af028fc2502f6ea/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f78466d4f742e706e67" alt="" /><br/>
It turns a standard Vim&#8217;s status line into the prettiest thing ever, but also packed with the functionality. For me, two things are absolutely critical - it changes color when you change the editing mode, which makes it super-easy to figure out if you&#8217;re in Normal or in Insert mode and it highlights your current pane, which alleviates my biggest pain with multiple panes (no pun intended) - I constantly lose track of what is my currently active pane. This little plugin cures both problems and does it with a style.
The only caveat is that it requires special patched fonts to display all those fancy characters, so it&#8217;s slightly less portable, but installation of those fonts takes about a minute and it looks so good, that I don&#8217;t really care about this extra step.
By the way, my own command line tools settings (aka &#8216;dotfiles&#8217;) are available <a href="https://github.com/xenocid/dotfiles">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.codethinked.com/preparing-yourself-for-modern-javascript-development">Preparing Yourself for Modern JavaScript Development</a></strong>: Pretty good articles explaining how modern, complex JavaScript apps are composed. It&#8217;s important, because there&#8217;s a pretty big leap between understanding the basics of JavaScript that will allow you to read (and write) simple code snippets and ability to tackle some modern JS framework like <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, let alone write something similar. This article is a good bridge between those two states.</li>
